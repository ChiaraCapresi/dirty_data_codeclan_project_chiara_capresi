# 1.4 Task 4 - Halloween Candy Data

I started reading the three files and investigating a few of their properties, like 'dim', 'names of columns'...

## These are the cleaning operations that i did to all the three files:

- I changed the names of a few columns I was interested in, using simpler names and equal for all the three dataframes.

- I changed the format of the 'age' column in integer, considering as NAs also all the ages greater than 100 years old.

- I used the 'pivot_longer' function for listing all the candie into a unique column

- I removed the square brackets around the candies' names in the first two datasets and the 'Q6: |' in the third one.

- I selected only the columns I was interested in: "year", "age", "gender", "going_trick", "candies", "appreciation_rating" and "country".

- I checked the NAs, even if I didn't do nothing for any of those, because I think in this case would be better to maintein them as they are.

- I wrote the three cleaned file into a new folder.

### Specific cleaning actions for 'candy_2015':

- I added the columns 'gender' and 'country' which were not present in the original dataset.

- I extracted the year from the Timestamp column and changed the name of the column in year.

### Specific cleaning actions for 'candy_2016':

- I added the column 'gender' which was not present in the original dataset.

- I extracted the year from the Timestamp column and changed the name of the column in year.

- I cleaned the country column by performing the following steps:

  1. converting every country in lower case
  2. converting every number in NAs
  3. identifying all the possible denomination for "USA", "UK", "netherlands", "cascadia", converting them into a unique denomination
  4. identifying any further invalid expression, converting it in NAs
  5. changing all the country names, a part from "USA" and "UK" in title format.
  
## .Rmd Analysis Script.

### I answered to the following questions:



   1. What is the total number of candy ratings given across the three years. (Number of candy ratings, not the number of raters. Donâ€™t count missing values)
   2. What was the average age of people who are going out trick or treating?
   3. What was the average age of people who are not going trick or treating?
   4. For each of joy, despair and meh, which candy bar received the most of these ratings?
   5. How many people rated Starburst as despair?
   6. What was the most popular candy bar by this rating system for each gender in the dataset ?
   7. What was the most popular candy bar in each year?
   8. What was the most popular candy bar by this rating for people in US, Canada, UK, and all other countries?
